# 🛍️ Sales Forecasting with CatBoost, XGBoost & Prophet

This project explores time series sales forecasting using three powerful models:
- **CatBoost**
- **XGBoost**
- **Facebook Prophet**

We initially applied several machine learning models, then moved to **optimized XGBoost** and **CatBoost** pipelines for improved forecasting accuracy. Finally, we integrated **Prophet** for interpretable trend and seasonality analysis.

## 📊 Key Features
✅ Daily and monthly sales forecasts  
✅ Optimized ML pipelines (XGBoost, CatBoost)  
✅ Model comparison plots  
✅ Prophet trend and seasonality decomposition  
✅ Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE
